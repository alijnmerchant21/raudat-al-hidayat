# Words of Wisdom

1. Beware of stinginess and greed, for they have truly brought ruin on those before you.
2. Prefer for your mumin brother what you prefer for yourself. Prefer for all people what you prefer for yourself. Prefer for all others (all of creation) what you prefer for yourself.
3. Kufr (unbelief), at its very least is for a man to hear a remark from his mumin brother and remember it with the intention of censuring him. Those who act in this way have no share of good in the hereafter.
_censure: to express strong disapproval or harsh criticism. _
4. When you become angry, desist from speaking ill.
_desist: to cease from an action; stop._
5. When a man passes while food has been placed before you, invite him if he greets you all with salaam. If he fails to do so, then do not invite him.
6. Pay a labourer his wages before his perspiration dries.
7. Spread goodwill and peace by reciting salaam, engage in feeding others, ensure good relations with kin and pray namaaz at night while others sleep; you will enter janaat in peace. (inshallah)
8. The worthiest of all merits is to: <br>
  a. reconcile with those who have severed relations with you,<br>
  b. be generous to those who have deprived you,<br>
  c. show kindness to those who have wronged you, <br>
  d. forgive those who have treated you unjustly.
9. The most honourable quality of the Nabiyeen, Siddiqeen, Shohadaa' and Saaleheen is visiting one another for the sake of Allah.
10. Shall I not inform you of two things which require little effort, yet provide great reward? From among the deeds with which one meets Allah there are none such as these; silence and good character.
